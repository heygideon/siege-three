# Quack

It's like Honk, but it goes quack instead. Because ducks are cool. ðŸ¦†

**Week 3 theme:** Signals

- Enter your name to create or join a two-person room
- Send ephemeral messages to each other, in the moment
- Emoji reactions and pings to be fun and/or annoying
- Nice sound effects (and haptic feedback on phones!)

> Best experienced in Chrome, or a Chrome-like browser. You'll also need a friend, or another device, if friends aren't your thing.

## Development

Iff you want to try this on your computer:

```sh
pnpm install
# and then (to run server and app at the same time):
pnpm -r --parallel dev
```

## Inspiration

[Honk](https://honk.me/) and [an article by its co-creator Benji Taylor](https://benji.org/honkish) about how it was built. It just looks really cool + different, so I wanted to see how close I could get!
